  <h2><span class="subtitle">NÂº 01</span>Overview </h2>
<p class="pCS">
    TrueaDataâ€™s Analytics show what makes an audience unique. For example our analytics could show ACME CO.â€™s demographics are made of 85% people under the age of 35; pointing to a marketing plan designed for millennials. I modernized our analytics to enable marketers to make clear and decisive actions.
</p>
<p class="pCS ">
When I joined TrueData, this is what our analytics looked like:

<ul class="CSList">
    <h2 style="margin-left: 12px ;"><span class="subtitle">NÂº 02</span>Let's fix this </h2>
  <li class="countList">Improve data sources<br> Better data means better results</li>
  <li class="countList">Layout, theres no need for endless scolling<br> Charts are too large by default</li>
  <li class="countList">Add color <br> Data stands out better with redundant-encoding</li>
  <li class="countList">Add more charting types than just a bar graphs</li>
  <li class="countList">Make data actionable</li>

</ul>


<div class="CStwo">
    <h2><span class="subtitle">NÂº 03</span>Improve Data Sources</h2>
  <p class="pCS">
My first step whenever I begin designing is usually to talk to our customers. For this project it was more important to go to our Engineers/SMOs to learn about what was feasible, and ask two important questions: <br>   
<br> <span class="quote qcs"> "What data do we already have that we aren't using?" </span><br>
<span class="quote qcs"> "What data do our partners have that we havent bought yet?"</span><br>
<br> I gathered 54 new data types that we weren't currently showing our customers, and then went to go and talk with them to begin learning.
 I did a quick poll and card sorting activity to find out what was most useful from the data that we currently displayed, and what (if anything) was not useful. 
<br><br> Next I repeated the exercise, this time adding in the new data sets. We learned a ton about what our customers were most excited about having access to, and what was essentially useless.
<br><br> Finally, we had a tehcnical and buisness model discussion, to maximize value and the time of our limited engineering resources.

  <h2><span class="subtitle">NÂº 04</span>Update Layout</h2>
  <p class="pCS">
As we added more analytics I implemented a grouping system, so that data types could be compared and sorted by tabs. With a long list of available graphs, and each graph being a vertical bar chart, the layout was too homogenous and prone to losing your place in.
