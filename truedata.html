                <p class="questions">The dashboard had 3 modules: Monthly reporting the revenue generated by an audience (applying to only 1 of our 3 &quot;personas&quot; (but we used the &quot;Jobs to be done&quot; method)), a Data transfer module that was only used by 3% of our clients, and a current snapshot of the users (in your most recently built audience, but that information wasn&#x27;t displayed anywhere.)<br><br>So we had information that was usable to only a small percent of our users taking up half the screen, and the other half of the screen was information that wasn&#x27;t clearly defined, or actionable.</p>

                <h4><span class="bd-span">3. </span>Tactics</h4>
                <p class="questions">I ran a 2-week long design sprint to come to a proposed solution, prototype, test, and build as rapidly as possible (pending success). The first 4 days of the sprint I spent meeting with our customers, asking them what their pain points were, getting to know what we could do to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, and see what we had overlooked. I then wrote up a findings document, presenting the results at the beginning of the next week. We took the remainder of the week to ideate, vote on solutions, prototype, and test.</p>

                <h4><span class="bd-span">4.</span> Outcome</h4>
                <p class="questions">We learned that there is a lot of universal confusion around audience targeting. We kept hearing questions like:<br><span class="text-span">- &quot;What size audience should I target?&quot;<br>- &quot;What key demographics am I not targeting that I should?&quot;<br>- &quot;How do I know if the ad was bad, or the targeting was bad?&quot;</span>So we decided to change the layout of the dashboard to help answer some insecurities customers were having. Some of the questions customers had have no right answers, for example: &quot;What size audience should I target?&quot; Without testing the audience there is no way to know, sometimes niche targeting vastly outperforms wide reach &amp; vice-versa.  To fix this problem we began grouping audiences into &quot;test plans&quot;. Let the users build multiple different audiences, distribute ads to all of them, see which segments outperform, and continue to iterate.<br><br>To help customers decide who to target we built an algorithm that used look-a-like modeling data from CRM files, similar companies, and previously built audiences to find audience segments that over-index compared to the U.S. Census.</p>

I collapsed all sections by default to clear clutter and reduce long-form anxiety. I exposed our logical &quot;IF&quot;, &quot;AND&quot;, &quot;OR&quot; operators and made them editable instead of fixed to give customers flexibility in getting the exact audience they wanted (our initial state was &quot;AND&quot; logic between data-types(gender, age, etc.) and &quot;OR&quot; logic within data-types). I introduced a data upload product for users to upload a list of Advertising IDs, Hashed emails, or plain-text emails that we would hash for them. Side by side with data upload I introduced robust error handling to account for when a file upload failed, uploading multiple files, and informing users of formatting errors in their file. Eventually, I was able to build a silent script that validated the file formatting and fixed any errors before being sent and ingested into our server.</p>

                <p class="questions">Once an audience gets built, they must be actionable. Primarily, a customer has to be able to send the audience to the correct destination. Additionally, a customer may want to see breakdown analytics of the audience they&#x27;ve built, review a summary of audience, and edit the audience or its name.<br>My impact to this page was mostly aesthetics, copy, and the workflow for distributing audiences to the correct destination.</p>

                <h4><span class="bd-span">3. </span>Tactics</h4>
                <p class="questions">My first problem to tackle was the copy. Initially our copy prompting customers to build an audience was &quot;Profile&quot;. We refereed to the process of studying and reviewing an audience as &quot;Profiling the audience&quot;. Our customers did not understand what that meant, but responded strongly to &quot;Analyze&quot;. I also changed the button text for &quot;Analyzing an audience&quot; from &quot;Start&quot; to &quot;Generate&quot; in order to show that it was a complex process that could take some time. I also included a percentage based loading bar to give an estimate of when the process would finish.<br>‍<br>For the distribution page, I separated the page into three different sections: &quot;Direct Export&quot; - Companies that we had a direct integration with or required customers to download the file to their local machine and directly upload; &quot;Configured Destinations&quot; - Our customers often distributed to 1-5 places, and the details of those destinations such as account number, never changed. We cached that information on our secure servers for them. And finally, all &quot;Available destinations&quot; - add a new destination by finding the card of the destination. We added logos, a search bar, and a filter by type so users could quickly find what they were looking for.</p>

After building an audience, or uploading First-party data, users can turn on the ability to see the breakdown of the audience by demographics, app-ownership, locations visited, or hardware characteristics. However in their original state, the charts were too big, occasionally taking up more than an entire vh, loosing the impact of the chart. Additionally, the charts &quot;infinitely&quot; scrolled causing users to have to have to go back and forth to see different charts. Finally, the charts were not actionable, they were helpful at identifying future audiences to target, but customers had to go to a different page.</p>

                <p class="questions">I planned and ran a 2-week sprint starting by meeting with our CTO, CPO, and data providers to talk about what analytics we are gathering that we currently don&#x27;t display but could, what analytics we don&#x27;t currently gather (but could), and what data we want (but don&#x27;t have and don&#x27;t know how to get it). Next I made prototype visualizations of the agreed upon analytics and started putting them in front of customers to get feedback on what was useful to them, what we missed, and overall interest in the product. Several customers independently brought up the idea of building an audience from the analytics, supporting our theory. Subsequent steps included designing and testing layouts, reporting colors/themes, working with engineering to find the right charting library (d3 obviously), and interaction design for selecting charts.</p>

                <h4><span class="bd-span">4.</span> Outcome</h4>
                <p class="questions">Our first step was to divide charting into sections. Age, gender, income all went into &quot;demographics&quot;; App indexing, total app installs, app categories went into &quot;App install&quot;, etc. We found that customers mostly wanted to compare charts within the card sorted categories. If a customer wanted to compare two charts in different sections, we had a check box appear on hover allowing selection and comparison across tabs. We also made the charts smaller so they fit 5-6 in a grid on a page, with the option to expand individual charts to full screen.<br>‍<br>Next we enabled customers to toggle chart types between pie, bar, divided bar, timeline, cluster, and icon, with options specific to each chart.<br>‍<br>I also designed a system for displaying and comparing multiple audiences at a time, so customers could see how they differ and standout.<br>‍<br>Finally, the most asked for feature, Building an audience from analytics. A dropdown menu allows users to either check boxes of the available analytics, or select the individual divs of each charts by clicking.</p>
