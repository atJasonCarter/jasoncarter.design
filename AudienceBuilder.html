  <h2>Finding the man of your dreams</h2>
<p class="pCS">
TrueData's core product is matching our customers with the perfect audiences for them. For a long time, this was a manual process, performed by our wonderful Customer Management team and Sales. Our team would process the results and email them to our customers. As our client list grew, the workload was not scalable for our Customer Management team and we decided to take our internal tool and make it customer facing.
</p>
<p class="pCS ">
Over the next year and a half we would take this tool from a bare forum to a unique tool that solved pain points in ways none of our competitors were.
</p>
<p class="pCS">
It's not a pretty interface, but the initial tools available on our audience builder were:
</p>
</div>

<ul class="CSList">
  <li class="countList">Audince name input</li>
  <li class="countList">List of apps your customer would ideally have installed on their mobile devices</li>
  <li class="countList">List of apps your customer cannot have installed on their mobile devices</li>
  <li class="countList">Age range of targeted audience (check boxes)</li>
  <li class="countList">Gender of Target Audience (only M/F options)</li>
  <li class="countList"> Device Characteristics (Phone manufacturer, and Model)
  </li>
</ul>
